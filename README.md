SMTP RFC:https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5321
IMAP RFC:https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3501

SMTP is a push protocol and can only be used to send emails
IMAP and POP3 are pull protocols and can be used to download mails to local machine.
POP3 will delete mail from the mail server and therefore I am not using it.
